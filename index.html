    <h1>Hi everyone! Welcome to my first codepen project.</h1>
    <p>My name is <strong>Ben</strong>, and I am excited to learn more about web development.</p>
    <p>You can check out my <a href="https://github.com/BSchoolland">github</a> or my <a href="https://benjamin-schoolland-portfolio-01dc3cbf3c1e.herokuapp.com/">portfolio</a> to see some of my projects. (the portfolio might take 30 seconds to load because of the way it is hosted)</p>
    <h3> Here's a little project I thought it would be cool to make for this codepen.</h3>
    <p> You can place walls between the character and the goal by clicking on the grid. The character will find the shortest path to the goal.</p>
    <div class="menu">
        <button id="start">Find Path</button>
        <button id="reset">Reset</button>
    </div>
    <div class="grid" id="grid"></div>
